## Config

### Emulation
  Preset 4

### GS

#### HW hacks
  * alpha - fixes shadows - Just alpha not alpha stencil


## Observations:
1. Preset 3 is a viable option but preset 4 seems to handle better loading new places

## Results
1. Some textures are still missing or incorrect like character eyes
2. Some LOD still fails to load correctly like grass in the distance
3. Game usually runs at 100%, when entering new areas might slow down but regains speed a bit after
4. Reached 40% of completion of the game no major issues
